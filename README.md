This release contains the best-performing PPO agent trained for ~900k steps on the CarRacing environment. The model was trained on a T4 GPU (Google Colab) using Stable-B.  This checkpoint showed the most stable driving behavior, smoother steering, and better overall track coverage compared to the earlier checkpoints (300k, 700k, 800k).
